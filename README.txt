	the reason this readme exists is to explain the technical situation of Player class and Enemy class,

	Player has values =
	Name
	Health
	Shield
	Lives
	Status
	Gameover

	Enemy has values = 
	Name
	Health

	
	Shield, Lives, Status and Gameover were not added to Enemy due to unrealistic portrayal in example, 
	
	Enemies would not have these values in a game, maybe shield but it seems like an extra layer of confusion,

	instead the seperation of these values as well as the addition of applied knowledge for constructors will attempt to demonstrate understanding of concept.


	
	
	a Battle manager is used for the debug due to encapsulation, 
	this manager would handle the battle system and create each battle scenario therefor it should hold the debug for it aswell, 
	Perhaps debug should be it's own class?
